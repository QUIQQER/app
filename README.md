QUIQQER App
========

Build a smartphone app from your QUIQQER project!  

Now you can't just be found in the app stores of Apple and Google but also your website becomes offline available.  

And all of that dead easy without any programming knowledge!  

In your QUIQQER system you comfortably configure everything from colors and logos up to menus and ads.
Download the generated files and an easy to use script does the rest for you.
Just like this you create your own app in no time!  

Since all content of the app is served from your QUIQQER system you manage the app's content with the QUIQQER WYSIWYG-Editors and have no need to always upload new versions to the app stores.  

By optionally embedding Google ads in your app you can generate additional income easily.  

Features summerized:

Present your QUIQQER website mobile and also offline
Completely customizable from colors and logos to menus and ads
Directly use the generated app or customize it even more with some programming knowledge (an Ionic App is generated)
Update the apps content with the QUIQQER WYSIWYG-Editor without uploading new app versions to the app stores
Earn money by optional ads in your app with Google AdMob
